# Installing Vendor Libraries

This document explains how to install the required vendor libraries for the collab-web application's backend. The backend uses PHP and relies on Composer to manage dependencies.

## PHP Dependencies (using Composer)

1. **Install Composer:** If you don't have Composer installed, follow the instructions on the official Composer website: [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)

2. **Navigate to the API directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `api/` directory of your project. This is where the `composer.json` file is located.

3. **Install dependencies:** Run the following command to install the required PHP libraries:

```bash
composer install
```

This command will read the `composer.json` file and download the specified packages and their dependencies into the `vendor/` directory.

4. **Include autoload file:** In your PHP scripts (e.g. api.php) include the autoload file generated by composer at the beginning of your script to make these libraries available:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```


## Python Dependencies (Using Pip - Optional)

You are using Python scripts in `api/` for preprocessing tasks. If these scripts have dependencies, use `pip` to install them.


1. **Install Pip (if not present):** Pip is usually included with Python installations.  If it is not present, refer to pip installation documentation:  [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

2. **Install project requirements:** Navigate to the `api/` directory (where your requirements.txt file resides) in your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` and installs all listed packages into your Python environment.  If no `requirements.txt` is needed,  install your python requirements one-by-one.  For example:

```bash
pip install phpmailer
```


After completing these steps, the necessary vendor libraries for both PHP and Python will be installed in your project, allowing the backend to function correctly.  Always keep `composer.json` and `requirements.txt` updated and commit them to source control to make project setup reproducible.

## Development Environment

Using tools like MAMP or XAMPP will greatly simply development and testing in localhost.
